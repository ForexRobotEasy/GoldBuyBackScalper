# GoldBuyBackScalper

GoldBuyBackScalper is a trading robot designed to trade the XAU/USD pair in the forex market. It utilizes advanced algorithms to identify and trade V-shaped reversals, incorporates trailing stops for effective risk management, and avoids trading during news events to protect the account from volatility.

## V-Shaped Reversals

The `IdentifyVShapedReversals()` function is responsible for identifying V-shaped reversals in the XAU/USD pair. It analyzes price movements and provides signals for entering and exiting trades based on these reversals. The implementation code for identifying V-shaped reversals is located within this function.

## Trailing Stops

The `TrailingStops()` function is responsible for incorporating trailing stops into the trading strategy. Trailing stops are used to effectively manage risk and lock in profits as the trade moves in favor of the trader. The implementation code for trailing stops is located within this function.

## Avoiding News Events

The `AvoidNewsEvents()` function includes a mechanism to avoid trading during news events. Trading during news events can be highly volatile and unpredictable, which can lead to significant losses. This function helps protect the account by skipping trading during these events. The implementation code for avoiding news events is located within this function.

## Main Function - OnTick()

The `OnTick()` function is the main function for the GoldBuyBackScalper trading robot. It is executed on each tick of the price and contains the logic for the trading strategy. 

1. It first checks if there is a news event using the `IsNewsEvent()` function. If there is a news event, it calls the `AvoidNewsEvents()` function to skip trading during that time and returns.

2. If there is no news event, it calls the `IdentifyVShapedReversals()` function to identify V-shaped reversals in the XAU/USD pair.

3. Based on the identified V-shaped reversals, the function then checks if there is a signal to enter a trade using the `IsVShapedReversal()` function. If there is a signal, it calls the `ExecuteTrade()` function to enter the trade.

4. If there is no entry signal, the function checks if there is a signal to exit the trade using the `IsExitSignal()` function. If there is a signal to exit, it calls the `CloseTrade()` function to exit the trade.

5. Finally, the function calls the `TrailingStops()` function to adjust the stop-loss level using trailing stops.
